# Landing Page Project

## Project Description

a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. Often times, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, I dynamically added the content to the page. I demonstrate this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM.

## Usage
Click on one of the navbar links at the top of the page and you will be sent to the part of the page anchor-linked to the navbar. When the section top reaches the top of the viewport, you'll see magic.

## Dependencies
I did not use any dependencies to build this project. Its 100% pure, good old vanilla javascript.
