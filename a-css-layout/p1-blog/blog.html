          Let's assume that one of the students that have been assigned to you
          reached out and said, the course is too hard and thinking of quitting
          and not completing the Nanodegree program. How would you respond?
        </b>
        <p>
          I would say "<u>Become a google developer</u>!" What does it mean? Let
          me tell you something to make it crystal clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once, my friend and I were using the computers in a local library. For
          some reason, the internet was lagging that day and my friend was
          getting more and more angry every time he couldn’t open website
          properly. Hoping that the speed would go back to normal and he would
          calm down, I kept reading and ignored his behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few minutes later, he banged his fist on the table so hard that all
          30 people sitting in the same room looked at us. At this point, I
          realized that I had to do something. So, I asked him if I could use
          his computer for a second. Then, I simply googled “how to control
          anger” and opened the first website at the top of the search page and
          started reading. By this time, he had calmed down a little but the
          anger was still there. I then turned the monitor to him so that he
          could read it too and I went back to my computer. Within a few minutes
          of reading about a solution to his problem (anger), he was not only
          calm but curious about anger management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like my friend, whenever I encounter a problem I ask google for
          help and 9 times out of 10 I get the help I need. Not only do I google
          coding problems but also, I search for info about health,
          productivity, religion, people, business etc. I can assure you that
          all developers, I mean literally all experienced developers are google
          developers no matter what language they use to code b/c technology is
          such a vast field that its nearly impossible to learn everything which
          is why even the developers with 10 plus years of experience get stuck
          and need Google’s help.
        </p>
        <p>
          What you’re going through is just a part of being a developer. I
          admit. Its hard in the beginning. It’s not easy to keep coding when
          you have a bug like every 5 minutes but you should keep one thing in
          mind. Soon, that minute will turn into hours and then days and weeks,
          months and so on. As time goes by, the number of problems will
          decrease while the number of wins increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you know it, you will feel like you have magic powers as
          compared to everyone else b/c you will be making things that make
          people say “Wow! How’d you do that?”. What’s even better is that you
          will have the potential to impact not just hundreds or thousands but
          millions of lives across the globe like Michael Jackson did and leave
          a legacy that can lives on forever and get a lot of love too, as a
          result. I think nothing feels better than a complete stranger coming
          up to you in the street with a big smile on his/her face and giving
          you a big hug and saying “Thank you! Your app has changed my life!”
